# Unvalkyried Heavens

## This is an unofficial fork of Valkyrien Skies by Triode et al.

This is a project aiming to improve compatibility of the mod so it can be better utilized in 1.12 modpacks until Valkyrien Skies 2 graces this version.
It does not add any new content beyond fixes.
It will not be updated for any newer Minecraft versions, VS2 is taking care of that.
